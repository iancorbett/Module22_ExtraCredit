#Module22_ExtraCredit

Description: For this project, I am making an online store front.\. I received starter code for this project, but had to make modifications to the code in order for it to be functional. 
In order to use the application, users will click the login/Signup link and then create an account or log in. Then they will be able to look through the catalogue for a book of their choice by title. 
The application will store their items in a cart and calculate the total cost as well. Users will then be able to add their items of their choice to a list that they can view at any time.

For this project, I did not have any starter code or copy any code from other projects or repositories. However, I did receive help from a tutor named Ryan. 
I was having issues with the front end actually rendering in the browser, but he was able to help me reslove this issue and get the rest of the application working.
Additionally, we added files in the utils folder and this helped the application function as it was supposed to.
